# Article Crawler

I'm interested in writing some news crawlers and doing sentiment analysis on the
results. Let's see who is the most positive and who is the most negative news.

## News Services

- https://www.cnn.com/
- https://www.bbc.com/
- https://www.foxnews.com/
- https://www.npr.org/

## Notes

I'm interested in Foreign News as well as different levels of analysis (i.e.,
CNN vs Economist).

I'll start small, with the four listed, then branch out. It would be nice to
have an insane amount of crawlers for an insane amount of news sites.
